## **S E T U P**

1Ô∏è‚É£ `Backend launch & its dependencies`  
To launch the backend you must go via your terminal in the folder and installing the *dependencies* needed to run the project : üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```node
cd groupomania back
npm install
```


2Ô∏è‚É£ `Database`  
The **database** of this project has been realized with **sequelize**.
### üö® what is sequelize ?

Sequelize üß¨
-
*Sequelize* is a promise-based Node.js ORM for 

- **Postgres**, 
- **MySQL**, 
- **MariaDB**, 
- **SQLite** and 
- **Microsoft SQL Server**. 

It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

Sequelize follows Semantic Versioning and supports *Node v10* and above.

sequelize-cli
-

*sequelize-cli* is is a command line interface for *sequelize*
it allows versioning of your database by keeping track of changes and evolution of your database throughout your project.
sequelize-cli is used for data migration and database bootstrapping

To begin it is necessary to connect to **mysql** with your usual login and password.  
[For more Information ü§î](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)

Then create your **database** called **groupomania** via mysql  with the commands :
```sql
CREATE DATABASE groupomania;
```
selected it with :
```sql
USE groupomania;
```

 Or on **phpmyadmin** by starting your server with **xampp** **lampp** **mampp**.

Be aware that it is also possible to create your database with `sequelize` from the terminal with the command :
```
npx sequelize-cli db:create groupomania
```

Then from the project terminal without the backend part run the command :
```sql
npx sequelize-cli init
```

This command creates 4 folders üóÉÔ∏è

- **config** folder with the *config.json* file 
- **migrations** folder 
- **seeders** folder and 
- **models** folder containing an *index.js* file.


In the json file of the config folder created by the previous command, replace the default name of database 
```json
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
"database": "database_dev",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
```
by :

```json
 "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "groupomania",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
```
The default dialect is `mysql` you can change by the one you use.

You can enter a password, but **don't forget** to create an `.env` file in the root of the project to **protect your information**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ `Sequelize Commands`

when your database is created generate the models of the `users` and `posts` tables. 

the command used to generate the user table :

```sql
sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string, lastName:string, email:string, password:string,imageUrl:text,admin:boolean
```

commands used for the post table
```sql
sequelize-cli model:generate --name Post --attributes userId:integer,content:text,imageUrl:text
```

sequelize db:migrate:undo                   Reverts a migration

sequelize db:migrate:undo:all               Revert all migrations ran

sequelize seed:generate                     Generates a new seed file

sequelize db:seed                           Run specified seeder

sequelize db:create                         Create database specified by configuration

sequelize db:drop                           Drop database specified by configuration

sequelize init                              Initializes project

sequelize init:config                       Initializes configuration

sequelize init:migrations                   Initializes migrations

sequelize init:models                       Initializes models

sequelize init:seeders                      Initializes seeders

sequelize migration:generate                Generates a new migration file

sequelize migration:create                  Generates a new migration file

sequelize model:generate                    Generates a model and its migration

sequelize model:create                      Generates a model and its migration
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ `Database Export File ` 

Inside the project you will find a sql file containing the database.

Once imported you will be able to use all the features.

5Ô∏è‚É£ `Launch üöÄ`
